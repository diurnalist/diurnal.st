      With 15+ years in software engineering and 10+ years in technical leadership, I'm a full-stack 
      generalist who has evolved from frontend development to platform engineering and observability. 
      I excel at bringing clarity to complex technical challenges and developing teams to tackle 
      high-impact problems together.

        <li>
          Migrated infrastructure to federated identity, improving onboarding UX for
