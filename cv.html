      With 15+ years in software engineering and 10+ years in technical leadership, I'm a full-stack 
      generalist who has evolved from frontend development to platform engineering and observability. 
      I excel at bringing clarity to complex technical challenges and developing teams to tackle 
      high-impact problems together.

          or developer execution.
        </li>
        <li>

      <h4>Development and Operations Lead</h4>
      <p>
        I was responsible for organizing all development and operations contributions
        from staff located in multiple facilities; functionally, this role "steers the
        ship" of a mid-scale research cyberinfrastructure, working closely with the PI

      <ul>
        <li>
          Delivered novel testbed platform for edge/IoT research by extending existing
          OpenStack and Kubernetes components. MVP in 5 months (design and
          implementation.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed open-source packaging of Chameleon systems, monitoring, and
          operational knowledge (e.g., runbooks, docs), reducing the complexity of
          deploying a bare metal research testbed to a new host institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Migrated infrastructure to federated identity, improving onboarding UX for
          users while decoupling IAM concerns from existing applications. This made it

        </li>
        <li>
          Developed, maintained, and extended the cloud computing control plane that
          powers six installations of Chameleon, providing clusters of KVM, bare metal
          and edge/IoT resources. Worked on a daily basis w/ a wide variety of tools
          and technologies across systems, networking, and storage.
