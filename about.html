<article id="bio">
  <p>I am a software engineer currently located in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
  <p>I currently work on the <a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org">Chameleon Cloud experimental testbed</a>. Previously I worked for <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>.</p>
  <p>I like to write and think about software and design and am a chronic doodler.</p>
  <p>You are a rare breed if you are still reading this, and I want you to know that I appreciate it.</p>
  <p>We may not know each other yet, but I encourage you to get in touch with me if you want to speak more</p>
  <p>We should grab drinks sometime.</p>
  <p>We are not alone.</p>
