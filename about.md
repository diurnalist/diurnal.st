title: About the author

I am a software engineer currently building [Chameleon
Cloud](https://www.chameleoncloud.org), an NSF-funded mid-scale cyberinfrastructure for
computer science research.

This space is for documenting solutions to difficult (or simply annoying) problems I've
encountered in my work. Occasionally I have the urge to write something outside of a
professional context. In all cases, I hope it is as useful for others to read as it was
for me to write.
