## Lighting (buttons)

what causes 'bloom' effect : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disc

- realistic buttons (give links to css3 buttons everywhere)
- breakdown of the various aspects of a button, typically
   - has gradient light/dark (top/bottom as if lit from the top)
   - why lit from the top? sun
   - reflected light (small) on the bottom edge
   - border of some type (depth effect)
   - shadow around the bottom sometimes
   - sometimes the button at the top has a bright border

What is the reason?

- show light reflection model off a button
- reflected light, different sources

Other examples

- other ui that has light/dark balance

## Animation

- mostly applicable to touch-sensitive interactions, but everywhere
- mouse acceleration has been around for a while
